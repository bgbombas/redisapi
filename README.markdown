# redisapi

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tsuru/redisapi.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tsuru/redisapi)

This API exposes a Redis service to application developers using [tsuru
PaaS](http://tsuru.io).

## Installation

The `redisapi` uses `mongodb` to store data about redis instances, and uses `docker` to spawn redis instances.

To install the api, all you need is a machine with `python` and `pip` installed. Clone the `redisapi`, `cd` into the created directory and then run:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Configuration

This API is ready to be deployed as a tsuru application. It depends on the
following environment variables:

* **REDIS_SERVER_HOST**: the address of the server to which the API will
  provide access. _Default value:_ ``none``. redisapi will fail to start if
  this variable is not defined.
* **REDIS_SERVER_PORT**: port used to connect to the Redis server. _Default
  value:_ 6379.
* **REDIS_SERVER_PASSWORD**: password used to connect to the Redis server.
  _Default value:_ none. When undefined, access will be unauthenticated. For more
  details, check "Authentication feature" at <http://redis.io/topics/security>.
* **REDIS_PUBLIC_HOST**: the public hosts that apps will use to connect to
  the redis server. This may be useful in the cases where you have a public and
  a private IP, the private IP is used by the API to manage the server, and the
  public API is delivered to apps whenever tsuru binds it to a service
  instance. _Default value:_ the value of ``$REDIS_SERVER_HOST``.

## Healthchecker

The `redisapi` has a module that creates healthcheckers for the redis instances created by the api. By default
the healthchecker is disabled. To enable it you should set the environment variable `HEALTH_CHECKER` with the
name of monitoring tool that you wants to use. Currently only `zabbix` is supported.
